Notes: This website mostly referenced w3schools and the slides provided to us on blackboard. The font (called Pershot) was used for the logo. It was a free font offered on the social media app X @ SesoHQ.
For the pictures of the guitars, these originated from the respective vendors.

				<p> Guitars come in many different shapes and sizes!
					They can vary in the number of strings (i.e. it can have 6-8 or even 12)
					The most common type of guitar types that most people can differentiate are electric and acoustic guitars!
					While acoustic guitars haven't seen too many changes. </p>
				<p> A lot of guitar vendors have undertaken many Frankenstein projects to produce electric guitars that push the boundaries of what a guitar can look like & sound like!
					Electric guitars produce their sound through their interaction with the guitar's strings and electronics, which are called pickups. </p>
				<p> Some examples of guitar pickups are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Single coils which have a bright presence </li>
					<li> Lipstick which have a lighter presence </li>
					<li> Humbuckers which produce warm and aggressive tone </li>
					<li> P-90s which have a gentle/low tone </li>
				</ul>
